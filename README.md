# Simple Logger
This application uses [Logbook](https://github.com/zalando/logbook) to leverage logs from web requests and responses, combined with [Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) which is responsible to format them as a valid JSON.
This application doesn't cover all corner cases for a production ready software, but serves as a general idea. Sugestions of any kind are welcome.
